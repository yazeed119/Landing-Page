# Landing Page

In CSS Style, a lot of changes have been made to the project to be the style you see on the screen interface now, and a lot of modifications have been made to be responsive to all types of screens.

Not many modifications were made to the HTML file, just two additional sections (4 and 5) added to the page.

I did not add any modifications to the HTML file

I implemented the project as required on Abb.js, as follows:

1. Build a goUp  button at the bottom of the page to move to the top of the page when clicked.
2. Made scrolling smoother by using EventListener.
3. Build NavBar using buildNav() function.


## The Project Contains These Files :
1. index.html
2. css /
styles.css
3. js /
app.js
